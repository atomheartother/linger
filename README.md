# Linger

Linger is a very simple mobile app I built for my girlfriend, who obsesses over specific songs for long periods of time.

It's a local music player which lets you create playlists and assign a weight to each song on a playlist before playing the list randomly. Songs are then more likely to appear in your queue based on their weight.

That's it, it's pretty simple.
